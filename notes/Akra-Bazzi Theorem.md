# Akra-Bazzi Theorem

The Akra-Bazzi theorem is a mathematical method used in the analysis of algorithms, particularly those involving recursive functions. It provides a solution for asymptotic analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms with non-equal subproblems or varying recursion depths. The theorem is an extension of the Master Theorem and can handle more complex cases.

In simple terms, the Akra-Bazzi theorem helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run based on its structure and the size of its input. It provides a way to calculate the big O notation (time complexity) of an algorithm when standard methods may not apply.

The theorem was proposed by Ziad Akra and Lata Bazzi in 1998. To apply it, one needs to identify the recurrence relation representing the algorithm, then use the formula given by the theorem to find out its asymptotic solution.
